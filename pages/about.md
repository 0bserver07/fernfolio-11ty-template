#### Why Create This?
My girlfriend wanted a portfolio and I offered to help build it. After some research, I knew [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) was the right tool for the job. It is simple, powerful, written in javascript, and framework free. I found a few good starter projects, but was overall unhappy with the current theme options. That led me to develop Fernfolio. The goal was not to create a technical masterpiece, but to create a beautiful portfolio with minimal overhead/complexity. Something that just works.

This project is open source so that hopefully someone else can use this as a template (or reference) in building their own site. Technical details can be found on the [Github repo](https://github.com/TylerMRoderick/fernfolio-11ty-template) and some customization instructions can be found [here](/posts/theme-customizations/).
