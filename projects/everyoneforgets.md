### What is in the name?

Everyone Forgets is a review of my weekly journal about forgetting and learning.

> "The life ofÂ  every man is a diary in which he means to write one story, and writesÂ  another; and his humblest hour is when he compares the volume as it isÂ  with what he vowed to make it."?--?J.M. Barrie


I once read this somehwere at the back of a bathroom stall before going on stage at a local open mic that I used to attend everynow and then. I wouldn't say this quote is a life changer, but it did spark the interest in me that I'm not the asboulte loser that I thought I am, if I only kept writing and going back on stage.

Part of me died in 2020 during one of the narliest period of my life, with that went my desire for writing. That being said, I never shied away from stage and going back on stage got me writing again in different shape and form.

That being said, writing is only one part of the equation. I need to riff on ideas, I need to recall the things I forget, you forget, we all forget on daily basis.

### Why is that important?

Well I think forgetting is a part of learning, it is also a useful thing, imagine if you always remembered the most embarssing day during first year of school. (Side note, if you do, please write it out and seek out help, don't let that ship bottle up in there).

There is more to forgetting, but the other side of the coin is learning.

We are never short of philosphy lectures on learning, brain and all that jazz.
But hear me out, what I want to say here is that most learning happens on our own behind closed doors. That's where the magic happens, that shit have been my saviour. I want to talk about learning on your own, when the cheatsheets, cliffnotes and cyber-friends are not enough.
